# Animal üê¢ Button üîò Box üì¶

Project for [Making Embedded Systems](https://classpert.com/classpertx/courses/making-embedded-systems/)

It uses among other things:
 - [Adafruit Feather RP2040](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-rp2040-pico) 
 - [Bosch BNO055](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/smart-sensor-systems/bno055/)
 - [Waveshare E-Paper Display](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.54inch_e-Paper_Module)

What is it supposed to do?

Imagine a little cube that you can hold in your hand.  
On its front display you can see an e-ink display displaying the silhouette of a turtle.  
On its top face sits a round arcade button. The device seems to be sleeping.  
You shake the cube and the button lights up and the device emits a squeak.  
You press the button and a new random animal silhouette appears on the screen.  
After you set the cube back on the table, the device purrs and goes back to sleep.  

It is a work in progress.

## Used Libraries

This project uses driver and example code from (Waveshare's E-Paper Repository)[https://github.com/waveshareteam/e-Paper/tree/master].

The project depends on the [RPi Pico SDK V1.5.1](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk) which is licensed under [BSD-5 Clause](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk?tab=BSD-3-Clause-1-ov-file#readme).

The BNO055 module was heavily influenced by [Adafruit's BNO055 library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BNO055) which is licensed under [MIT license](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BNO055?tab=MIT-1-ov-file).

The serial console module is ~~totally stolen~~heavily influenced from the Elecia White's implementation [here](https://wokwi.com/projects/324879108372693587) and the [corresponding repo](https://github.com/eleciawhite/reusable) which is licensed under an (https://github.com/eleciawhite/reusable?tab=License-1-ov-file)[Unlicense].

## Configuring the environment

This was built and depends on the [RPi Pico SDK V1.5.1](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk)

Its location must be set as an environment, e.g.:

```shell
export PICO_SDK_PATH="your_local_path"
```

The project is configured for the Adafruit Feather RP2040.
To change this, please change the follwing line `./CMakeLists.txt` in the projects root directory.

```cmake
set(PICO_BOARD "adafruit_feather_rp2040")
```
And `PICO_BOARD=adafruit_feather_rp2040` in `./build.sh`

Add a `./build` folder and run `cmake ..` from inside it.

## Building and flashing

Run `./build.sh`

If you are using [picotool](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool) you can simple flash in two steps:

1. Bring the board into BOOTSEL mode by holding the the same called button while resetting
2. Write the built `.uf2` onto the board with the following command:
    ```shell
    "PATH_TO_PICOTOOL/picotool load .build/debug/src/console_poc.uf2
    ```
